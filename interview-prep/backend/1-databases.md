### 1. What is a database management system (DBMS), and can you name some examples?
A Database Management System (DBMS) serves as an intermediary between users and the database. It facilitates data maintenance, retrieval, and ongoing management, using a structured mechanism to ensure data integrity, security, and efficiency.

#### Types of DBMS
1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Organizes data into tables with predefined structures defined by a schema. SQL (Structured Query Language) is typically used for data operations. Common examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

2. **NoSQL DBMS**: Evolved as a response to the limitations of RDBMS, designed for unstructured or semi-structured data and horizontal scalability. Examples include MongoDB for document-oriented storage and Redis for key-value stores.

3. **Cloud-Based DBMS**: Hosted on cloud platforms, these systems provide flexibility and scalability, requiring minimal maintenance from users. Notable examples are Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Bigtable, and Azure Cosmos DB.

4. **NewSQL DBMS**: Combines the benefits of traditional RDBMS with modern needs like scalability. These systems often offer improved performance, designed for big data scenarios. Examples include Google Cloud Spanner and NuoDB.

5. **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)**: Designed for managing complex, object-based data models. They provide persistence for objects, disentangling the object structure from a relational schema. ODBMS are less popular in current times, but examples include db4o and ObjectStore.

6.b**In-memory DBMS**: Maintains data in the systemâ€™s memory, enabling rapid access and processing. Examples include Oracle TimesTen and Redis.

7. **Multimodel DBMS**: Can handle multiple kinds of databases, such as key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases. This offers a variety of data models in a single system. ArangoDB is an example of such a system.

8. **Graph DBMS**: Specialized for dealing with interconnected data elements. They are optimized for operations like traversals and pathfinding. Neo4j is a well-known example of this type of DBMS.

### 2. Explain the ACID properties in the context of databases.
**Atomicity**
Atomicity ensures that all tasks in a transaction are completed or none are. Databases use transaction logs to manage atomicity. If a task fails, the transaction log allows the system to recognize the incomplete state and restore to the last known consistent state.

Consider a banking transfer: if the debit is successful but the credit fails, atomicity ensures that the debit is also rolled back.

**Consistency**
Consistency requires that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. It ensures that data integrity rules are not violated. For example, after a transfer, the sum of account balances should remain the same.

**Isolation**
Isolation ensures that the operations within concurrent transactions are invisible to each other until they are completed, to protect against potential conflicts and inconsistencies.

Different isolation levels, like read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, and serialize, define the extent to which transactions are isolated from one another.

**Durability**
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes persist, even in the event of a system failure. This is typically achieved through mechanisms such as write-ahead logging and buffer management, which ensure changes are written to disk.

### 3. What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?
SQL and NoSQL databases vary in several key aspects. Here, I will elaborate on five of them.

Key Distinctions
- **Data Structure**: SQL databases are table-based, whereas NoSQL databases can be document, key-value, wide-column, or graph-oriented.

- **Schema**: SQL databases are schema-based. They necessitate database schema, and any deviation requires schema modifications. NoSQL databases are either ad-hoc, making each document consistent with one another, or schema-on-read.

- **Querying**: SQL databases employ Structured Query Language to execute queries. NoSQL databases use methods specific to their data model.

- **Scalability**: SQL databases historically have employed vertical scaling or "scaling up" by increasing CPU power, memory, and storage on a single node. However, recent trends show support for horizontal scaling or "scaling out" across multiple nodes. NoSQL databases, by nature, support horizontal scaling more readily, making them "scale-out" architectures.

- **ACID**: Traditional SQL databases often guarantee ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance. NoSQL databases, especially in eventual consistency models, might trade off immediate consistency for performance and availability.

### 4. Describe a relational database schema.
A Relational Database Schema is a set of rules that define the structure, constraints, and relationships of data tables in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

### 5. What is database normalization, and why do we use it?
Database normalization is a set of practices that ensure data integrity by minimizing redundancy and dependency within a relational database.

**Advantages of Normalization**
- Data Consistency: Reduction in redundancy decreases the risk of inconsistent data.
- Improved Maintainability: With a more structured database, maintenance becomes more straightforward.
- Easier Updates: Normalization usually means fewer records to update.

**Normalization Levels**
There are generally six levels of normalization, from 0 to 5 or "BCNF".

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**
1. Unique Primary Keys: A table should have a unique primary key for each record.
2. Atomic Values: Each cell in a table should hold a single value, eliminating multi-valued attributes.
* **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
All requirements of the previous form, as well as:
1. Removal of Partial Dependencies: Non-primary key columns should depend on the entire primary key.
* **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
All requirements of 2NF, as well as:
1. Elimination of Transitive Dependencies: Non-primary key columns should not be dependent on other non-primary key columns.
- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
A stricter version of 3NF that ensures each determinant is a candidate key.
* **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**
Deals with multi-valued dependencies.
* **Fifth Normal Form (5NF**)
Also called "Projection-Join Normal Form" and deals with join dependencies.

**Normal Forms and Use-Cases**
Most relational databases aim for 3NF, as it typically strikes a good balance between performance and data integrity.

However, it's essential to understand the specific requirements of your database and decide on an optimal normalization level accordingly. For instance, reporting databases might not be heavily normalized to improve query performance.

### 6. What is denormalization and when would you consider it?
Denormalization is the process of reducing normalization (typically for performance reasons) by introducing redundant data into one or more tables. While normalization ensures data integrity, denormalization mainly focuses on improving query performance by eliminating complex JOIN operations.

### 7. What is the N+1 query problem and how can you solve it?
**N+1 Query Problem** arises when an object graph is retrieved using a query that results in unnecessary database hits.

For instance, consider a **one-to-many relationship** where each "Order" has many "LineItems". If you fetch all "Orders" and then individually fetch their "LineItems," it leads to multiple query rounds. These excessive queries are inefficient, especially when the number of related items is high.

Let's say, in a more specific case, you fetch:

1. All Orders.
2. Then for each Order, fetch its LineItems.

This corresponds to:

1. Primary Query: SELECT * FROM Orders.
2. Secondary Query: SELECT * FROM LineItems WHERE order_id = :order_id (Potentially executed several times based on order count).
Here you have an N+1 scenario because the second query is executed "N" times, once for each Order, hence N+1.

**Solutions to n+1 query problem**
1. **Use a join query**: so that you can retrieve related entities in a single query, an orm can handle this for you
2. **Leverage lazy loading**: Some ORMs are configured to execute extra queries only when a related object is accessed for the first time. This is known as **lazy loading**. It reduces the initial query size, improving efficiency but might lead to an N+1 problem if multiple related entities are accessed.
3. **Use explicit eager loading**: Modern ORMs often provide mechanisms for **explicitly defining** which related entities to fetch eagerly. This way, you can still benefit from lazy loading while strategically opting for immediate access when needed. In Entity Framework (EF) and Java Persistence API (JPA), for example, you can use annotations like **@ManyToOne** and **@OneToMany** to control lazy/eager loading behavior.

### 8. What are indexes and how do they work in databases?
An index serves as a data structure in a database system. It enhances the efficiency and speed of data lookup operations by logically ordering the indexed data.

**Index Types**
* B-Tree (Balanced Tree): Suited for ranges and equality operations, such as using WHERE clauses in SQL.
* Hash: Ideal for exact-match lookups, like primary keys.
* Full-text: Specifically designed for text searches, often seen in search engines.
* Bitmap: Efficient for low-cardinality columns, where there are few distinct values, like gender.

**Data Lookup Using Indexes**
* Ordered Scans: Possible through B-Tree indexes where data is sorted, aiding range queries.
* Exact-Match Sequencing: For Hash and tree-based indexes, this ensures swift exact-value matches.
* Range Searches: Supported by B-Trees, they enable operations like finding numbers within a range.

**Best Practices**
* Consider Index Maintenance Overhead: While indexes speed up reads, they might slow down data modifications like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
* Index Tailing: Place more selective columns first, and follow them with less-discriminatory columns for best results.
* Index Coverage: Aim to cover frequently queried columns, but don't go overboard, leading to index bloat.
