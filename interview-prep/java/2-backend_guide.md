### Section 1: Core Skills

#### Programming Language Proficiency

1. **Syntax and Semantics**

   1. **Explain the differences between `==` and `equals()` in Java.**
      - `==` checks for reference equality, meaning it checks if both references point to the same object.
      - `equals()` checks for value equality, meaning it checks if two objects are logically equivalent.

   2. **How do you define and use enums in Java?**
      ```java
      public enum Day {

          }
      }
      ```

   3. **What is the difference between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`?**

   5. **Explain the concept of generics in Java. How do you use them?**
      - Generics allow types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. This enables code reuse and type safety
      ```java
      public class Box<T> {
          private T t;

          public void set(T t) {
              this.t = t;
          }

          public T get() {
              return t;
          }
      }
      ```

      usage
    ```

          while (low <= high) {
              int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

              if (arr[mid] == key) {
                  return mid;
              } else if (arr[mid] < key) {
                  low = mid + 1;
              } else {
                  high = mid - 1;
              }
          }
          return -1;
      }
      ```
