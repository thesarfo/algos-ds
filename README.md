#### common hints in problem statements that often indicate the potential use of specific algorithms

1. **"Find the shortest path":** This often points towards graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs.

2. **"Traverse all the nodes/vertices":** This hints at graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

3. **"Maximum/minimum":** These keywords can suggest the use of dynamic programming or algorithms like Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum.

4. **"Permutation/combination":** Problems involving permutations or combinations might be solved using backtracking or recursion.

5. **"Sort the array":** This implies sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or even the built-in sorting functions in the language being used.

6. **"Subset/Subsequence":** Problems that deal with subsets or subsequences often involve dynamic programming or backtracking approaches.

7. **"Tree-related operations":** Keywords like "Binary Tree," "BST," or "Heap" often hint towards tree-based algorithms such as tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), balancing, or heap operations (heapify, heap sort).

8. **"Pattern matching" or "String matching":** These problems might involve algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt), Rabin-Karp, or regular expressions.

9. **"Optimization" or "Maximize/Minimize":** These can suggest the use of greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or linear programming techniques.

10. **"Connected components" or "Strongly connected components":** These terms often lead to graph-related algorithms like Tarjan's algorithm or Kosaraju's algorithm.
