### Problem:
You are given an array with an equal number of negative and positive values. The elements can appear in any random order. Your task is to rearrange the array elements by sign, alternately.

For example, given the array `[3, 1, -2, -5, 2, -4]`, we need to arrange it as `[pos, neg, pos, neg, pos, neg]`, preserving the order of appearance. The result for the input above would be `[3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]`.

[Leetcode 2149](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/description/)

### Approach 1: **Brute Force**

1. Create two empty arrays, `pos` (to store positive numbers) and `neg` (to store negative numbers).
2. Iterate over the input array, adding positive elements to the `pos` array and negative elements to the `neg` array, preserving their order of appearance.
3. Once the arrays `pos` and `neg` are filled, we will populate the original array with alternating values from `pos` and `neg`. 
   - Positive elements will occupy the even indices.
   - Negative elements will occupy the odd indices.

Since the number of positive and negative elements in the input array is **equal**, this guarantees that the rearranged array will be valid.

#### Brute Force Pseudocode:
```java
pos = [n/2];  // array to store positive numbers
neg = [n/2];  // array to store negative numbers
posIndex = 0, negIndex = 0;

// Step 1: Populate pos[] and neg[] with corresponding values from the input array
for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(arr[i] > 0) {
        pos[posIndex++] = arr[i];
    } else if(arr[i] < 0) {
        neg[negIndex++] = arr[i];
    }
}

// Step 2: Rearrange the input array with alternating positive and negative values
for(i = 0; i < n/2; i++) {
    arr[2 * i] = pos[i];     // place positive values at even indices
    arr[2 * i + 1] = neg[i]; // place negative values at odd indices
}
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(2n)**: We iterate twice—once to populate `pos` and `neg`, and once to rearrange the original array.
  
#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We are using two additional arrays, `pos` and `neg`, each of size `n/2`.

Can we improve this further?

### Approach 2: **Optimal Approach**

We can achieve the same result in a more efficient way using a single array `answer` and without the need for additional arrays like `pos` and `neg`.

1. We observe that positive elements should always occupy **even indices**, and negative elements should always occupy **odd indices** in the result array.
2. Initialize two pointers:
   - `posIndex` to track the next available even index for positive elements.
   - `negIndex` to track the next available odd index for negative elements.
3. Iterate over the input array and directly place the elements at their correct positions:
   - If the element is positive, place it at the current `posIndex` and increment `posIndex` by 2.
   - If the element is negative, place it at the current `negIndex` and increment `negIndex` by 2.

#### Optimal Approach Java Implementation:
```java
int[] answer = new int[n];
int posIndex = 0;  // Pointer for placing positive elements
int negIndex = 1;  // Pointer for placing negative elements

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(nums[i] > 0) {
        answer[posIndex] = nums[i];
        posIndex += 2;
    } else {
        answer[negIndex] = nums[i];
        negIndex += 2;
    }
}
return answer;
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the array once, directly placing the elements into their correct positions.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We are only using a single result array `answer` of size `n`.

## Another Variation - Positive and Negative Values are Not of Equal Length

In some cases, the number of positive and negative elements in the array may not be equal. When this happens, the task is to alternate between positive and negative values as much as possible, and any surplus elements (either positive or negative) should be appended at the end of the array without regard to order.

### Example Scenario:
Consider the array `[-1, 2, 3, 4, -3, 1]`. The alternating sequence will follow a pattern like `[pos, neg, pos, neg, ...]`, and since there are more positive numbers than negative, the remaining positive numbers will be added to the end of the array. For this case, the expected output would be something like `[2, -1, 3, -3, 4, 1]`.

### Steps:
1. **Separate Positive and Negative Numbers**: First, create two separate arrays (or lists) to hold positive and negative numbers. 
2. **Alternating Fill**: Using a loop, alternate between the positive and negative numbers as long as both arrays have elements. Keep track of the index as you fill the original array.
3. **Append Remaining Elements**: Once you can no longer alternate (when one of the arrays is exhausted), append the remaining elements from the larger array (either positive or negative) to the end of the array.

### Detailed Explanation:
For instance, take the array `[-1, 2, 3, 4, -3, 1]`:
- After separating the numbers, you have two arrays: `pos = [2, 3, 4, 1]` and `neg = [-1, -3]`.
- You will alternate the elements until one array is exhausted. In this case, after filling `2, -1, 3, -3`, the negative array is empty.
- The remaining positive elements (`4, 1`) will be appended to the end, resulting in the final array `[2, -1, 3, -3, 4, 1]`.

### Code Implementation:
Below is a Java implementation of this approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int[] alternateNumbers(int[] a) {
        // Arrays to store positive and negative numbers
        int[] pos = new int[a.length];
        int[] neg = new int[a.length];

        int posIndex = 0, negIndex = 0;
        int n = a.length;

        // Separate positive and negative numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > 0) {
                pos[posIndex++] = a[i];
            } else {
                neg[negIndex++] = a[i];
            }
        }

        // Fill the array alternately with positive and negative numbers
        int index = 0;
        int minLength = Math.min(posIndex, negIndex);
        for (int i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
            a[index++] = pos[i];
            a[index++] = neg[i];
        }

        // Append remaining positive numbers (if any)
        for (int i = minLength; i < posIndex; i++) {
            a[index++] = pos[i];
        }

        // Append remaining negative numbers (if any)
        for (int i = minLength; i < negIndex; i++) {
            a[index++] = neg[i];
        }

        return a;
    }
}
```

### Breakdown:
- **Positive and Negative Arrays**: We initialize arrays `pos` and `neg` to store positive and negative values from the input array.
- **Two-Pass Solution**:
  - **Pass 1**: Separate positive and negative numbers by iterating over the input array.
  - **Pass 2**: Using two loops:
    - First, alternate between positive and negative values as long as possible.
    - Then append any remaining elements from the array with surplus elements.
  
The solution has a time complexity of O(n), and space complexity O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

### Optimized Version:
Here's a pseudocode that summarizes the approach:

```java
for(i = 0; i < (smaller_array_size); i++){
    arr[i * 2] = pos[i];
    arr[i * 2 + 1] = neg[i];
}

// Add the surplus elements to the final array
int index = num_of_sorted_elements_in_final_array;

for(i = (greater_array_start); i < (greater_array_size); i++){
    arr[index] = greater_array[i];
    index++;
}
```

In this example, you:
- Alternate positive and negative values for as long as both arrays have elements.
- Append any remaining positive or negative values from the longer array.
