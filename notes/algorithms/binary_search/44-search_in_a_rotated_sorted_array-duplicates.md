Given a rotated sorted array `nums` that may contain duplicates and an integer `target`, determine if the `target` is in the array. If `target` exists, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

The challenge lies in the presence of duplicates because it can make identifying which half of the array is sorted difficult. For example, when the left and right boundaries of the search space are equal, the array could be unsorted, making the binary search condition fail.

### Approach to Solve the Problem

This problem is a variation of [searching in a rotated sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) with the added complexity of duplicates. The key observation is that when we encounter duplicates, we can't always rely on the binary search logic of determining the sorted half based on the comparison between `nums[low]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[high]`. 


#### 1. **Binary Search Setup**

We will use a modified version of binary search to account for the rotation and the presence of duplicates. We need to maintain two pointers: `low` and `high`.

#### 2. **Handling Duplicates**

When `nums[low] == nums[mid] == nums[high]`, the decision to which half of the array is sorted becomes ambiguous because the values at `low`, `mid`, and `high` are the same. In this case, we can't confidently determine which half is sorted, so we **shrink the search space** by moving the `low` pointer to `low + 1` and the `high` pointer to `high - 1`. This effectively skips over duplicate values and reduces the number of elements to search.

#### 3. **Identifying the Sorted Half**

After eliminating duplicates, we continue with the standard binary search logic:
- If `nums[low] <= nums[mid]`, the **left half is sorted**. We can check if the `target` is within this sorted range.
- Otherwise, the **right half is sorted**, and we check if the `target` lies within the right half.

#### 4. **Narrowing Down the Search**

Depending on which half is sorted, adjust the `low` and `high` pointers:
- If the target is in the sorted half, update `low` or `high` accordingly.
- If not, adjust the pointers to search the other half.

#### 5. **Edge Case Handling**

- If the target is found at any position, return `true`.
- If after checking the entire array the target is not found, return `false`.


Below is a code implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            // Check if mid is the target
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;

            // Handle duplicates: if nums[low] == nums[mid] == nums[high], we can't determine the sorted half.
            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high]) {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }

            // Identify if the left half is sorted
            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Check if the target lies in the sorted left half
                if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1; // Narrow search to the left
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1; // Narrow search to the right
                }
            } else { // Right half is sorted
                // Check if the target lies in the sorted right half
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1; // Narrow search to the right
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1; // Narrow search to the left
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false; // Target not found
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Key Points

1. **Dealing with Duplicates**:
   - When encountering the situation where `nums[low] == nums[mid] == nums[high]`, we move the `low` and `high` pointers inward to remove duplicates. This allows us to continue searching without making incorrect assumptions about the sorted half.
   - This adjustment prevents the search space from being stuck or misdirected due to duplicate values.

2. **Binary Search Adaptation**:
   - In normal rotated sorted arrays (without duplicates), binary search works efficiently by comparing the mid value with the boundaries (`nums[low]` and `nums[high]`). With duplicates, the algorithm needs to account for the possibility that the values at these boundaries are equal, making it hard to determine the sorted half. Hence, the shrinking technique (`low++` and `high--`) helps reduce search space.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - In the worst case (when we encounter many duplicates), the time complexity could degrade to `O(n)` because we might have to check all elements. However, for arrays without many duplicates, the complexity remains `O(log n)` due to the binary search logic.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The algorithm uses `O(1)` extra space since the search is performed in-place using only the `low` and `high` pointers.
