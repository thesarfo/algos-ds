### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if `n` new flowers can be planted in a flowerbed without violating the rule that flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. The flowerbed is represented as an array `flowerbed`, where:
- `1` means a plot is occupied (contains a flower).
- `0` means a plot is empty.

[Leetcode 605](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each plot in the flowerbed:
1. Check if it is empty (i.e., `flowerbed[i] == 0`).
2. Verify that both adjacent plots are also empty (if they exist).

If these conditions are met, a flower can be planted in the current plot. Keep a count of flowers planted, and if we reach or exceed `n`, we can return `true`.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a Counter**:
   - Use a `count` variable to track the number of flowers planted successfully.

2. **Iterate Through the Flowerbed**:
   - For each plot:
     - Check if it is empty (`flowerbed[i] == 0`).
     - Check if the left plot (if exists) and the right plot (if exists) are also empty.
   - If both conditions are met, plant a flower by setting `flowerbed[i] = 1` and increment `count`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If `count` reaches or exceeds `n`, return `true`.
   - If the loop completes and `count` is less than `n`, return `false`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the flowerbed array. We only make one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are modifying the input array in place and only using a constant amount of additional space.

### Code Implementation (Java)

Here is the Java implementation based on the greedy approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                // Check if the left and right plots are empty (considering edge cases)
                boolean emptyLeftPlot = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);
                boolean emptyRightPlot = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);
                
                if (emptyLeftPlot && emptyRightPlot) {
                    // Plant a flower here
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    count++;
                    
                    // Early return if count reaches n
                    if (count >= n) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If we finish the loop and haven't planted enough flowers
        return count >= n;
    }
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
- **Input**: `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 1`
- **Steps**:
   - Plot `1`: Already occupied.
   - Plot `2`: Empty, left is occupied, skip.
   - Plot `3`: Empty, both left and right are empty, plant flower here.
   - Result: `flowerbed` becomes `[1,0,1,0,1]`, `count = 1`, which meets `n = 1`.
- **Output**: `true`

#### Example 2
- **Input**: `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 2`
- **Steps**:
   - Plot `1`: Already occupied.
   - Plot `2`: Empty, left is occupied, skip.
   - Plot `3`: Empty, both left and right are empty, plant flower here.
   - Result: `flowerbed` becomes `[1,0,1,0,1]`, `count = 1`, which is less than `n = 2`.
- **Output**: `false`
