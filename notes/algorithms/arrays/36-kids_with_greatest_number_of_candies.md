### Problem Analysis
You are given an array `candies`, where each element represents the number of candies a child has. An integer `extraCandies` denotes the additional candies you can give to any kid. The goal is to determine if, by giving all `extraCandies` to each child one by one, they would have the **greatest number** of candies among all kids.

The solution should return a boolean array `result` such that:
- `result[i]` is `true` if giving all `extraCandies` to the `i-th` kid results in them having the most candies.
- `result[i]` is `false` otherwise.

[Leetcode 1431](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description/)

### Approach

1. **Identify the Current Maximum Candies**:
   - Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has, as this will serve as a benchmark.
   - This is done using the `max()` function on the `candies` array, resulting in `max_candies`.

2. **Evaluate Each Kid's Candies After Adding ExtraCandies**:
   - For each kid, add `extraCandies` to their current number of candies.
   - Compare this new sum with `max_candies`.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `max_candies`, then it’s possible for that kid to have the most candies, so append `true` to the result array.
   - Otherwise, append `false` to the result array.

3. **Return the Result Array**:
   - After evaluating all kids, return the `result` array, which will contain a boolean value for each kid, representing whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving the extra candies.

### Code Implementation

The code is simple and leverages Python’s `max()` function and a list comprehension to achieve the solution in a concise way.

```python
def kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies):
    # Step 1: Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has
    max_candies = max(candies)
    
    # Step 2: Prepare the result list by checking each kid's new candy count
    result = []
    for candy in candies:
        # Add extraCandies to current candies and compare with max_candies
        result.append(candy + extraCandies >= max_candies)
    
    # Step 3: Return the result list
    return result
```

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s go through an example to clarify how the code works.

#### Example Input:
- `candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]`
- `extraCandies = 3`

#### Steps:
1. **Find the Maximum Candies**:
   - From `candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]`, the maximum value is `5`.
   - Set `max_candies = 5`.

2. **Evaluate Each Kid’s Candies with ExtraCandies**:
   - **Kid 1**: \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is equal to `max_candies`, so result is `true`.
   - **Kid 2**: \(3 + 3 = 6\), which is greater than `max_candies`, so result is `true`.
   - **Kid 3**: \(5 + 3 = 8\), which is greater than `max_candies`, so result is `true`.
   - **Kid 4**: \(1 + 3 = 4\), which is less than `max_candies`, so result is `false`.
   - **Kid 5**: \(3 + 3 = 6\), which is greater than `max_candies`, so result is `true`.

3. **Result**:
   - The final `result` array will be `[true, true, true, false, true]`.

#### Final Output:
```python
[true, true, true, false, true]
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of kids. Finding the maximum takes \(O(n)\), and iterating through the list to create the result array also takes \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we create an array of the same size as `candies` for the result.
