### Problem Overview

You are given an array of `n` intervals. Each interval represents a range on the number line, such as `(1, 3)` meaning the interval starts at `1` and ends at `3`. The goal is to **merge all overlapping intervals** and return the smallest number of non-overlapping intervals.

For example, given the intervals:  
`[(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 9), (8, 10), (2, 4), (15, 18), (16, 17)]`

The merged intervals would be:  
- `(1, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(2, 6)` merge into `(1, 6)`
- `(8, 9)` and `(8, 10)` merge into `(8, 10)`
- `(15, 18)` and `(16, 17)` merge into `(15, 18)`

So the final merged intervals are `[(1, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]`.

#### Intuition:
When merging intervals, you cannot just merge everything into a giant interval like `[(1, 18)]`. The reason is that there are **gaps** between the intervals that can't be merged. For example, between `6` and `8`, there is a gap with no overlapping intervals. Each merged interval must cover only the continuous, overlapping parts.

In the example, the minimum number of intervals we can merge into is `3`:  
`(1, 6)`, `(8, 10)`, and `(15, 18)`.

### Solution Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:  
   You can try merging intervals by sorting them based on their start times. Then, you iterate through the intervals and check if the current interval overlaps with the previous one. If it does, you merge them; otherwise, you start a new merged interval.

2. **Optimal Approach**:  
   We can improve on brute force by only iterating through the intervals once, after sorting. Start by storing the first interval in your answer, then check each new interval:
   - If it overlaps with the last added interval, merge them.
   - If it doesn’t overlap, add the current interval to the answer as a new, separate interval.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s work through an example:

#### Input:
```
[(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 9), (8, 10), (2, 4), (15, 18), (16, 17)]
```

#### Step-by-step:
1. **Sort intervals** by the starting times:
   ```
   [(1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (8, 9), (8, 10), (15, 18), (16, 17)]
   ```
2. **Initialize**:
   - Start with the first interval: `(1, 3)`
   - We’ll check each interval and merge where possible.
   
3. **Check the second interval** `(2, 4)`:
   - It overlaps with `(1, 3)` because `2 <= 3`. So, merge them into `(1, 4)`.

4. **Check the third interval** `(2, 6)`:
   - It overlaps with `(1, 4)` because `2 <= 4`. So, merge them into `(1, 6)`.

5. **Check the fourth interval** `(8, 9)`:
   - It does **not** overlap with `(1, 6)` because `8 > 6`. Start a new interval `(8, 9)`.

6. **Check the fifth interval** `(8, 10)`:
   - It overlaps with `(8, 9)` because `8 <= 9`. So, merge them into `(8, 10)`.

7. **Check the sixth interval** `(15, 18)`:
   - It does **not** overlap with `(8, 10)` because `15 > 10`. Start a new interval `(15, 18)`.

8. **Check the seventh interval** `(16, 17)`:
   - It overlaps with `(15, 18)` because `16 <= 18`. So, merge them into `(15, 18)`.

#### Final Result:
```
[(1, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]
```

### Code Implementation

Here’s the optimal approach to solving the problem in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // If there are no intervals, return an empty array
        if (intervals.length == 0) {
            return new int[0][];
        }

        // Sort the intervals based on the start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        // This will store our merged intervals
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Initialize with the first interval
        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];

        // Traverse the sorted intervals
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            // If the current interval overlaps with the previous one, merge them
            if (intervals[i][0] <= end) {
                end = Math.max(end, intervals[i][1]);  // Extend the end time if overlapping
            } else {
                // If no overlap, add the previous interval and reset start and end
                result.add(new int[]{start, end});
                start = intervals[i][0];
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }

        // Add the last interval
        result.add(new int[]{start, end});

        // Convert the list back to a 2D array
        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the intervals**: O(n log n)
- **Merging intervals**: O(n) since we only loop through the intervals once.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of intervals.

### Space Complexity

- **Space for the result**: O(n) since we might store all the intervals in the worst case.

---

### Key Insights

- Sorting the intervals ensures that we only need to traverse them once to merge overlapping intervals.
- Efficient merging is done by comparing the start and end times and using a greedy approach to group intervals as much as possible.
