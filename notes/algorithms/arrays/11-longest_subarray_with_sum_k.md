### Problem Understanding:

You are given an array of positive elements, and your goal is to **find the longest subarray** with a summation equal to `K`, and **return the length** of that subarray.

A **subarray** refers to a "contiguous part of the array". For example, in an array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, subarrays like `[1, 2, 3]` or `[1, 4, 2]` are contiguous because their elements are adjacent to each other.

The task asks you to find the **longest** subarray where the sum equals `K`. For example, given `k = 3` and the array above, the subarrays `[1, 2]`, `[3]`, and `[1, 1, 1]` all sum to `3`. But the longest subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`, which has a length of `3`.

### 1. **Brute Force Solution**:

A brute force approach generates **all possible subarrays** and checks if their sum equals `K`. This is done by starting at each element of the array, extending to the end of the array, and checking the sum for each subarray.

Here’s how to visualize the process:

- For each starting element (`i`), you explore all subarrays starting from that index.
- For each starting index `i`, you extend the end index (`j`) to explore all possible subarrays.
- For each subarray, calculate its sum and if it equals `K`, compare its length to the maximum found so far.

#### Example:
For array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3]` and `K = 3`:

- Start from `i = 0`, form subarrays `[1]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, etc.
- Then move to `i = 1`, and so on.
- For each subarray, check the sum and update the longest length if the sum equals `K`.

**Code (Pseudo):**

```pseudocode
longest_len = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){         // Iterate over each starting index
    for(int j = i; j < n; j++){     // Extend to generate subarrays
        sum = 0;
        for(k = i; k <= j; k++){    // Calculate sum of the subarray
            sum += arr[k];
        }
        if(sum == K){               // If sum equals K, update the longest length
            longest_len = max(longest_len, j - i + 1);
        }
    }
}
return longest_len;
```

- This brute-force approach has a **time complexity of O(n³)** because of the nested loops.

### 2. **Better Solution Using Hashing (Prefix Sum)**:

To make the solution more efficient, we can use **prefix sums** and **hashing**.

#### Intuition:

1. **Prefix Sum**: The prefix sum at any index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`. If we know the prefix sum at two indices, say `i` and `j`, we can calculate the sum of the subarray between them.

   - Let’s say the prefix sum at index `j` is `S_j` and at index `i` is `S_i`. The sum of the subarray from `i + 1` to `j` is `S_j - S_i`.
   - So, if we want the sum of a subarray to equal `K`, we need to check if `S_j - S_i = K`, which means `S_i = S_j - K`.

2. **Hashmap**: We can use a hashmap to store each prefix sum we encounter along with its index. As we traverse the array:
   - Calculate the running prefix sum.
   - Check if `prefix_sum - K` exists in the hashmap. If it does, it means there’s a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `K`. The length of this subarray is the difference between the current index and the index where `prefix_sum - K` was found.
   - Update the maximum length if this subarray is longer.

#### Visualization:

- For the array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3]` and `K = 3`:
   - Start iterating and maintain a running prefix sum.
   - For each index, check if the difference `prefix_sum - K` exists in the hashmap.
   - If it does, that means there’s a subarray summing to `K`. Track its length and update the longest length.

#### Example:
At index `5`, if the prefix sum is `9`, and we are looking for `K = 3`, we check if `9 - 3 = 6` exists in the hashmap. If it does, there’s a subarray that sums to `3`, and we calculate its length.

**Code (Pseudo):**

```pseudocode
longest_len = 0;
prefix_sum = 0;
hashmap = {}   // To store prefix_sum and its index

for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum += arr[i]  // Update the running prefix sum

    if prefix_sum == K:    // Special case: sum from start to current index
        longest_len = i + 1

    if (prefix_sum - K) in hashmap:  // Check if (prefix_sum - K) exists
        subarray_len = i - hashmap[prefix_sum - K]
        longest_len = max(longest_len, subarray_len)

    if prefix_sum not in hashmap:    // Store the prefix_sum in hashmap
        hashmap[prefix_sum] = i

return longest_len;
```

- This approach has a **time complexity of O(n)**, making it much more efficient than the brute-force solution.

### 2. **Optimal Solution Using Two Pointers**:

We can use a two-pointer (or sliding window) approach, by following these steps:

### Approach

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Use two pointers, `i` (start of the window) and `j` (end of the window), both initially set to the beginning of the array. 

2. **Initialize Variables**: Set `sum` to 0 to keep track of the running sum of the current window and `maxLen` to store the maximum length of the subarray found so far.

3. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - Increment the `j` pointer to expand the window by adding the current element to `sum`.
   - If `sum` equals \( K \), update `maxLen` with the length of the current subarray (`j - i + 1`).
   - If `sum` exceeds \( K \), increment the `i` pointer to shrink the window until `sum` is less than or equal to \( K \). 

4. **Repeat Until All Elements Are Processed**: Continue expanding and contracting the window until `j` reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Result**: After processing the array, return `maxLen`.

### Java Implementation

Here’s how you can implement this approach in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int lenOfLongSubarr(int[] A, int N, int K) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;

        while (j < N) {
            // Add the current element to the sum
            sum += A[j];

            // If sum equals K, check the length of the current subarray
            while (sum > K && i <= j) {
                // Shrink the window from the left
                sum -= A[i];
                i++;
            }

            // If sum equals K, update maxLen
            if (sum == K) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, j - i + 1);
            }
            
            // Move the right pointer to expand the window
            j++;
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized at the start of the array, with `sum` and `maxLen` initialized to zero.
  
- **While Loop**: The outer loop runs until `j` reaches the end of the array:
  - **Incrementing the Sum**: The value at `A[j]` is added to `sum`.
  - **Checking Conditions**:
    - If `sum` exceeds \( K \), the inner while loop runs to shrink the window from the left by incrementing `i` until `sum` is less than or equal to \( K \).
    - If `sum` equals \( K \), it calculates the length of the current valid subarray and updates `maxLen`.

- **Result**: After iterating through the array, `maxLen` contains the length of the longest subarray that sums to \( K \).

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N) \) because each element is processed at most twice (once by `j` and once by `i`).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) since no additional data structures are used that depend on the input size.
