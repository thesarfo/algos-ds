The problem is all about merging two strings together in an alternating fashion. You take characters from both strings one by one and combine them into a new string. This way, you maintain the order of characters from each string while creating a new one. If one string is longer than the other, you'll simply append the remaining characters of the longer string at the end.

[Leetcode 1768](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/).

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - First, we determine the lengths of both strings, `m` and `n`. This helps us know when we've reached the end of each string.
   - We then create a `StringBuilder` named `result` to efficiently build our new string as it allows for mutable string operations.

2. **Two Pointers**:
   - We use two pointers, `i` for `word1` and `j` for `word2`, both initialized to `0`.
   - The main idea is to loop until we've processed all characters in both strings. 

3. **Alternating Merge**:
   - Inside the loop, we check if `i` is still less than `m`. If it is, we append the character from `word1` at index `i` to `result` and increment `i`.
   - Then we do the same for `word2` with index `j`. This ensures we always take one character from each string alternately until we've reached the end of both.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, after the loop ends, we convert the `StringBuilder` back to a string and return it.

### Example

For example, if we have:
- `word1 = "abc"`
- `word2 = "defg"`

The merged string will be `"adbcef"` and then add the remaining character from `word2` to get `"adbcefg"`.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s the solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while(i < m || j < n){
            if (i < m){
                result.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            } 
            if (j < n){
                result.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

This approach is straightforward and efficient, using simple loops and a `StringBuilder` to build the final string.
